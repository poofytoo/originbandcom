    STORY 
  </h1>
    <div class="separator"></div>
    <p>Origin, intially named Proxband, arose out of the need to help skydivers avoid canopy collisions by equipping skydivers with a wearable device such that they can effortlessly determine their distance from nearby skydivers</p>
    <img class="small-image" src="process/0.png" />
    <p>With all things pink, Origin's ancestors started as a young, flightless, baby bird. Development began with this metaphorical bird being powered by an Arduino, two XBees, a black and white LCD display, and a wallet-sized battery.</p>
    <img src="process/1.png" />
    <p>The form of the product began as a molded one-piece rubber assembly, enclosing an electronics container. This greatly helped with waterproofing and was easy to quickly prototype.</p>
    <img src="process/2.png" />
    <p>As our target audience shifted to skiers who wanted to know where their friends were, our physical form also changed.</p>
    <img src="process/3.png" />
    <p>We also experimented with different materials as our final form was being determined. Meanwhile, our graphic design team focused on creating an identity for Origin that would carry through the product</p>

    <p>To reduce the size of the device, as well as to simplify the manufacturing process, the soft strap was turned down in favor of a hard-case-with-stretchy-velcro thing.</p>
    <img src="process/5.png" />
    <p>And finally, we arrived at our alpha prototype. Enjoy!</p>
