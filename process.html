    STORY 
  </h1>
    <div class="separator"></div>
    <p>Origin, initially named ProxBand, arose out of the need to help skydivers avoid canopy collisions by equipping them with a wearable device to pinpoint other skydivers' locations.</p>
    <img class="small-image" src="process/0.png" />

    <p>Our initial efforts were centered around testing the radio and GPS communication technology.  An Arudino, XBee radio modules and a black and white LCD display were integrated together and proved this concept could work!</p>
    <img src="process/1.png" />

    <p>With the initial technology proven, we divided into teams.  One group worked on the electronics and coding, designing a custom PCB. The below image shows our board with the GPS chip magnified</p>

    <p>Our mechanical team began working on the form for Origin.  This initially was a rubber, molded wristband.</p>

    <p>Our design team began optimizing the User Interface and what functionalities we wanted Origin to have. This included a variety of forms, including one shown below.</p>

    <p>As we explored our graphic identity, there was also an onslaught of logos and designs!</p>
    <img src="process/4.png" />

    <p>With further iterations, our design continued to change</p>

    <p>And finally, we arrived at our alpha prototype. Enjoy!</p>
